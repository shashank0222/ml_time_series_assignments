One way to visually identify time-dependent seasonal components is to plot the data and look for changes in the seasonal pattern over time. For example, if the magnitude of the seasonal pattern appears to be increasing or decreasing over time, this may indicate the presence of a time-dependent seasonal component.\n",

    "Statistical methods can also be used to identify time-dependent seasonal components. One approach is to fit a time series model that includes both a seasonal component and an interaction term between the seasonal component and time.

This involves fitting a model with a seasonal component to a subset of the data, then shifting the window forward in time and refitting the model. By comparing the estimated seasonal components at different points in time, one can assess whether the seasonal pattern is changing over time."
